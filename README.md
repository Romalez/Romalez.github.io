## What Is Five Nights At Freddy's?
Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) is a video game series and media franchise created by Scott Cawthon. The first video game was released on August 8, 2014, and the resultant series has since gained worldwide popularity.

The main series consists of nine video games taking place in locations connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise named "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza", after its mascot, the animatronic bear Freddy Fazbear. In most games, the player assumes the role of a night-time employee, who must utilize tools such as security cameras, lights, doors, and vents to defend themselves against animatronic characters who inhabit the locations and become mobile and hostile at night. The series' lore is gradually revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and Easter eggs featured throughout the games.

The franchise also includes spin-off games and other media, such as a feature film adaptation, novel trilogy, and an anthology series, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. The franchise maintains an active fanbase, known for its production of fan art and fan games, and merchandise for the games is available internationally.

## Storyline Of The Game
The first game revolves around a character called Mike Schmidt, who begins working as a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where the animatronics move at night and supposedly kill anyone they see by stuffing them into a spare animatronic suit. Animatronic movement is explained to the player as a purposely programmed "free-roaming" mode, to prevent the animatronic's servomotors from locking up. The player must survive from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.

They cannot leave the room and must use a camera system and two doors with lights to defend themselves from the animatronics, with limited power to use their tools. The hostility of the animatronics appears to result from the possession by the vengeful souls of children who were killed at the restaurant. The player is guided by the previous night guard, known as Phone Guy, who assists them in their defense against the animatronics. Mike is fired from his job after the seventh night for "tampering with the animatronics, body odor and general unprofessionalism".

## Characters
**Animatronics** - They are far by the most recurring robots of the entire franchise. The animatronics are mostly created to look "life-like" in appearance to supposedly resemble actual living anthropomorphic creatures, which can be based on animals, humans, and even inanimate objects. They are designed with movable limbs, voice boxes, and covered by armor-like suit (made in fabric or plastic) to protect their endoskeletons. Commonly used for entertainment at public buildings (restaurants for example), they are also animatronics designed as electronic toys. Not every animatronics has full bipedal models, however. In Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location for instance, three human animatronic heads can be seen in the Primary Control Module location, possibly designed for testing facial expressions.

This robots, specifically animatronics and bots, are artificially-engineered mechanical entities created to automatically bring out a complex series of actions, appearing throughout the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. They are invented and established by robotics industries, mainly Fazbear Entertainment, Inc., Afton Robotics, LLC, and Fazbear Funtime Service.
